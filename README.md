# Word-Doc-to-Study-Cards

This project is a Python script that converts a Word document into flashcards. The script uses the python-docx library to open the Word document and extract the text of each paragraph. The script assumes that the Word document is formatted with questions and answers, where the questions are bullet points and the answers are the text under them.

The script converts the bullet points into questions and the text under them into answers, and stores the flashcards in a dictionary. The script then prints out each flashcard in the format "Question: [question] Answer: [answer]".

This script is a useful tool for creating flashcards from pre-existing Word documents, without having to manually create the flashcards. The script is easy to use, simply input the path to the Word document and the script will do the rest. It is also customizable, you can modify the script to suit your needs, for example by adding more formatting options or saving the flashcards to a file.

This script is open source and available on GitHub, you can use it freely and modify it to fit your needs.
